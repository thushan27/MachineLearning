# MachineLearning
Mini projects and exercises attempted from Explore Machine Learning using Python online course. The course involved using the sklearn package to build supervised learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to solve regression and classification problems. Also covered were random forests, hyperparameters, VIF and evaluating the performance of these models using R2, adjusted R2, confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall.
