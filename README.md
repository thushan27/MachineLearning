# MachineLearning
Mini projects and exercises attempted from online courses. Supervised Learning using Python involved using the Scikit-Learn package to build supervised learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to solve regression and classification problems. Also covered were random forests, hyperparameters, VIF and evaluating the performance of these models using R2, adjusted R2, confusion matrix, accuracy/precision/recall. Clustering using Python involved using the Scikit-Learn package to build unsupervised learning models such as KMeans, KMedoid and Agglomerative models, as well as measures such as Elbow Method and Silhouette Width.
