# MachineLearning
Exercises attempted as part of exploring Machine Learning using Python online course. The course covered various supervised learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees used to solve regression and classification problems. Also covered were random forest and adaboost, hyperparameters, VIF, evaluating the performance of these models using R2, adjusted R2, RMSE, precision, recall, confusion matrix.
